## Day 16 - Coffee Machine using Object Oriented Programming

### Day Challenge

Based on yesterday's project, we were provided the code for different methods and properties based on components of a coffee machine. We were to read the documentation and use the methods from the different classes to build the same coffee machine from yesterday.
