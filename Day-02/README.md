I made a simple bill calculator which receives the total bill as an input and prints you portion of the bill depending on the tip you want to leave and the number of people dining.

```python

two_digit_number = input()
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
####################################
# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = int(two_digit_number)
first_digit = two_digit_number//10
second_digit = two_digit_number%10
print(first_digit + second_digit)
```

```python

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
bmi = int(weight)/(float(height)**2)
print(int(bmi))
```

```python

age = input()
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
years_left = 90 - int(age)
weeks_left = years_left*52
print(f'You have {weeks_left} weeks left.')

#weeks_left = years_left*52 + (years_left/4). This roughly accounts for leap years
```
