# TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.ðŸ‘‡
for student in student_scores:
  score = student_scores[student]
  if score > 90:
    student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
  elif score > 80:
    student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations"
  elif score > 70:
    student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
  else:
    student_grades[student] = "Fail"
